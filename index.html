    <p class="text">"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was
        born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
        explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure
        itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter
        consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain
        pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can
        procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical
        exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to
        enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant
        pleasure?"</p>
